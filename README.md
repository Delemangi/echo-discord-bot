# Echo Discord Bot

Echo Discord Bot is a Discord bot that provides FAQ functionality. It's powered by [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) v14, [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) v5 and PostgreSQL v16.

It's recommended to run this application in a Docker environment if you wish to retain your sanity.

## Features

The bot provides a simple & customizable FAQ functionality with user friendly configuration through Strapi. The questions support links (as buttons) and files of different formats.

## Installation

For development purposes, be sure to run `npm run prepare` to install the Git pre-commit hooks.

### Installation (Docker)

The project is available as a Docker image on DockerHub as `delemangi/echo-discord-bot` and `delemangi/echo-strapi`. Beware that there are two (three with PostgreSQL) Docker images which have to be running at the same time.

2. Pull the images: `docker compose pull`

Using the repository:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Delemangi/echo-discord-bot.git`
2. Build the images: `docker compose build`

## Running

### Running (Docker)

Regardless of the Docker steps you have followed above for installation, run `docker compose up -d`, provided that you have a `docker-compose.yaml` file ready.

### Running (Normal)
